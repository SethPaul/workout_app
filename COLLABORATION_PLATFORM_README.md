# Realtime Collaborative Platform Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for designing and implementing a realtime collaborative platform, inspired by successful applications like Excalidraw, Figma, and other collaborative drawing/design tools.

## Current State

**Note**: This repository currently contains a Flutter workout application. The collaborative platform documentation has been created as guidance for building a separate realtime collaborative platform based on research into WebSocket architectures, conflict resolution patterns, and collaborative application design.

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
- **Version Numbers**: Track element versions for conflict resolution
- **Tombstoning**: Mark elements as deleted rather than removing
- **Nonce Tie-Breaking**: Deterministic resolution of simultaneous edits
- **State Merging**: Combine states from multiple clients consistently

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, Redis
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Canvas API
- **Testing**: Jest, Playwright, Artillery (load testing)
- **Deployment**: Docker, Nginx, Kubernetes

## Research Foundation

The documentation is based on extensive research into:

1. **Excalidraw's P2P Architecture** - Version-based conflict resolution, tombstoning
2. **WebSocket Best Practices** - Socket.IO features, connection management
3. **Collaborative Drawing Patterns** - Real-time synchronization, state management
4. **Conflict Resolution Algorithms** - CRDT principles, operational transforms
5. **Performance Optimization** - Batching strategies, canvas virtualization

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- WebSocket server with room management
- Basic canvas rendering engine
- Element model and state management
- Simple drawing tools

### Phase 2: Basic Collaboration (Weeks 3-4)
- Operation broadcasting
- User presence indicators
- Basic conflict resolution
- User identification and colors

### Phase 3: Advanced Sync (Weeks 5-6)
- Version-based conflict resolution
- Tombstoning for deletions
- State merging algorithms
- Network disconnection handling

### Phase 4: Tools & UX (Weeks 7-8)
- Advanced drawing tools
- Tool palette and properties
- Multiplayer undo/redo
- Export and persistence

### Phase 5: Security & Polish (Weeks 9-10)
- End-to-end encryption
- Access control and permissions
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing

## Quick Start

To implement the collaborative platform:

```bash
# 1. Set up project structure
mkdir realtime-collaboration-platform
cd realtime-collaboration-platform
mkdir -p packages/{server,client,shared}

# 2. Follow the Implementation Guide
# See IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md for detailed steps

# 3. Start with basic server
cd packages/server
npm install express socket.io cors helmet
# Implement CollaborationServer class

# 4. Create React client
cd ../client
npm install react react-dom socket.io-client
# Implement Canvas component

# 5. Test collaboration
# Open multiple browser tabs to test real-time sync
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- State management logic
- Conflict resolution algorithms
- Element versioning and merging

### Integration Tests
- WebSocket communication
- Client-server synchronization
- Multi-user collaboration flows

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete user workflows
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Network failure recovery

### Performance Tests
- Load testing with Artillery
- Concurrent user handling
- Memory and CPU optimization

## Deployment Options

### Development
```bash
# Local development with hot reload
npm run dev
```

### Production
```bash
# Docker Compose deployment
docker-compose up -d

# Kubernetes deployment (see implementation guide)
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

### Scaling
- Redis pub/sub for horizontal scaling
- Load balancing with nginx
- CDN for static assets
- Database clustering for persistence

## Security Considerations

### End-to-End Encryption
- AES-GCM encryption for all operations
- Client-side key generation and management
- No server-side data storage

### Access Control
- Room-based permissions (owner, admin, editor, viewer)
- JWT-based authentication
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

### Message Integrity
- HMAC authentication for all messages
- Replay attack protection
- Message ordering and deduplication

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics
- WebSocket connection count
- Message throughput (ops/second)
- Room participation rates
- Conflict resolution frequency
- Network latency and packet loss

### Logging
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Operation tracing and debugging
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
