# Workout App Realignment Plan

## Executive Summary

After thorough analysis of the codebase, documentation, and requirements, **the app has deviated significantly from the original vision**. While substantial technical infrastructure exists, the core user experience and business logic don't align with the desired behavior.

### Key Deviations Identified:

1. **‚ùå Missing Core Feature**: No "workout pool" concept - workouts are generated ad-hoc rather than selected from a curated pool
2. **‚ùå No Cadence-Based Selection**: Missing the "deadlifts every 7 days" scheduling logic
3. **‚ùå No Movement Library UI**: Users can't review/disable movements or equipment groups
4. **‚ùå Complex Template System**: Over-engineered template creation instead of simple pool management
5. **‚ùå Missing Equipment Filtering**: No way to disable equipment groups (e.g., "no GHD machine")
6. **‚ùå Wrong User Flow**: Bottom tabs instead of simple daily workout selection

### Current State Assessment:
- **Technical Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ Solid (95% complete)
- **Core User Experience**: ‚ùå Misaligned (30% aligned)
- **Business Logic**: ‚ùå Wrong approach (40% aligned)
- **Data Models**: üü° Partially correct (70% aligned)

## Original Vision vs Current Implementation

### **DESIRED BEHAVIOR** (From Requirements):
```
Essential functionality:
‚Ä¢ App has a POOL of workouts
‚Ä¢ Each day user selects to have a workout PULLED from the pool
‚Ä¢ Selection adheres to criteria (e.g., deadlifts every 7 days)
‚Ä¢ Pool is reviewable and allows disabling specific workouts
‚Ä¢ Allow disabling groups by equipment (e.g., no GHD machine)

Example week:
‚Ä¢ Day 1: Heavy deadlift + push press, 3x5s (from pool)
‚Ä¢ Day 2: EMOM 10 minutes 5 cleans (from pool)  
‚Ä¢ Day 3: Intervals, cycling/rowing (from pool)
‚Ä¢ Next week: Deadlift + push press again (7-day cadence)
```

### **CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION**:
```
‚ùå No workout pool - workouts generated on-demand
‚ùå No cadence tracking - no "every 7 days" logic
‚ùå Complex template system instead of simple pool
‚ùå No movement library UI for users
‚ùå No equipment group disabling
‚ùå Bottom navigation instead of daily selection focus
```

## Comprehensive Realignment Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Core Issues (Week 1)
**Priority: CRITICAL - Foundation Fixes**

#### 1.1 Create Workout Pool System
- **Current**: Workouts generated ad-hoc from templates
- **Fix**: Create pre-populated workout pool with cadence tracking
- **Implementation**:
  - Create `WorkoutPool` model and repository
  - Populate pool with 50-100 predefined workouts
  - Add cadence fields (`daysInterval`, `lastPerformed`)
  - Implement pool selection algorithm

#### 1.2 Implement Cadence-Based Selection

- **Implementation**:
  - Add `MovementCadence` model (movement, daysInterval, lastPerformed)
  - Create cadence validation logic
  - Implement smart workout selection based on cadence rules

#### 1.3 Simplify Main UI Flow
- **Current**: Complex bottom navigation with templates
- **Fix**: Simple daily workout selection
- **Implementation**:
  - Replace bottom nav with single "Today's Workout" screen
