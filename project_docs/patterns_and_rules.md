# Patterns and Rules Reference

## Rep/Set/Structure Patterns
- Main movement + 2-3 accessory movements
- Accessory/finisher movements often listed with reps (e.g., 5 high pulls)
- Cardio/conditioning elements (e.g., 500m row, 1 mile run, 3 minute run)
- Interval patterns: 30 on 30 off, Tabata, EMOM
- N rounds (fixed rounds)
- AMRAP (as many rounds/reps as possible)
- Clusters (likely cluster sets)

## Cadence/Scheduling Rules
- Each day is anchored by a primary lift or movement
- Movements have a cadence (e.g., deadlift every 7 days)
- Workouts remain in rotation until completed
- Intensity and format vary by day

## Other Notes
- Accessory movements can be grouped and rotated
- Some days are more technical/diversity focused, others are strength + burst cardio
- Monthly "slog" workout (long, moderate effort)

_Note: These are based on observed data and should be refined as more is analyzed._
