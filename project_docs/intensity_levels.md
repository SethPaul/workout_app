# Intensity Levels Reference

## High Intensity (H)
- Maximum effort workouts
- Short duration (typically 5-15 minutes)
- High heart rate zones (80-100% of max)
- Examples: Tabata, Sprint Intervals, Heavy Lifts
- Recovery needed: 48-72 hours

## Medium Intensity (M)
- Moderate effort workouts
- Medium duration (15-30 minutes)
- Moderate heart rate zones (60-80% of max)
- Examples: EMOM, Circuit Training, Moderate Weight Lifts
- Recovery needed: 24-48 hours

## Low Intensity (L)
- Light effort workouts
- Longer duration (30+ minutes)
- Lower heart rate zones (50-70% of max)
- Examples: Steady State Cardio, Technique Work, Mobility
- Recovery needed: 12-24 hours

## Notes
- Intensity levels should be adjusted based on:
  - Individual fitness level
  - Recovery status
  - Training goals
  - Previous workout intensity
- Consider cumulative fatigue when planning workout sequence
- Mix intensity levels throughout the week for optimal results
- Use RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) scale as a guide:
  - H: 8-10/10
  - M: 6-7/10
  - L: 4-5/10
